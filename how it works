Hello Everyone,
I am Aayush Bhatt and i am sharing my project of Laser light security system using LDR and Arduino UNO:-
  LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) is the sensor that changes its resistance as the intensity on light on it changes.
  We are going to program arduino to measure the change in intensity on light and if the intensity decreases it should trigger alarm.
